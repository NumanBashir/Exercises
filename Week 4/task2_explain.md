Trace lines (from OFMC) and mapping:

1. (x702,1) -> i: {x702,i,NA(1),KAB(1)}\_(pk(i))

   - Protocol mapping: A -> B : {A,B,NA,KAB}\_(pk(B)) was sent, but the intruder intercepted it and substituted its own identity.
   - Meaning: A's initial encrypted proposal was redirected so the ciphertext was actually destined for the intruder's public key `pk(i)`.

2. i -> (x701,1): {x702,x701,NA(1),x308}\_(pk(x701))

   - Intruder action: the intruder forwards a crafted message to honest B, using a different session key `x308`.
   - Why intruder can: by intercepting A's original message, the intruder can construct a new ciphertext targeted at B that contains a replaced session key under the intruder's control.

3. (x701,1) -> i: {|x702,x701,NA(1)|}\_x308

   - Protocol mapping: B -> A : {|A,B,NA|}\_KAB (confirmation) — B replies using the session key it believes is correct (`x308`).
   - B is acting legitimately: it uses the session key it decrypted from the (forged) message in step 2 and returns the confirmation encrypted under that key.

4. i -> (x702,1): {|x702,i,NA(1)|}\_KAB(1)

   - Intruder action: the intruder forges/forward a confirmation to A, but crafted to match the `KAB(1)` A originally used.
   - Why intruder can: the intruder manipulated keys so A sees a valid confirmation under the key it believes is in use; the intruder can produce or forward a message encrypted under that key to convince A.

5. (x702,1) -> i: {|x702,NA(1)|}\_(sk(x702,s))

   - Protocol mapping: A -> s : {|A,NA|}\_sk(A,s) — A contacts the server `s`, using the A–S shared key, to get a signed attestation.
   - Meaning: A sends its blinded proof to the server; because of previous steps A believes the session is progressing normally.

6. i -> (s,1): {|x702,NA(1)|}\_(sk(x702,s))

   - Intruder action: the intruder forwards A's message to the server `s`.
   - Why intruder can: the intruder acts as a network relay and can forward messages unchanged.

7. (s,1) -> i: {x702,NA(1),s}\_inv(pk(s))

   - Protocol mapping: s -> B (or responder) : {A,NA,s}\_inv(pk(s)) — server signs and issues the attestation for A and NA.
   - Server is acting legitimately: it signs the triple (A, NA, s) and sends it to the requester (here the intruder).

8. i -> (x701,1): {x702,NA(1),s}\_inv(pk(s))

   - Intruder action: the intruder forwards the server's signed attestation to B.
   - Why intruder can: the attestation is valid and signed by the trusted server; forwarding it does not break its validity.

9. (x701,1) -> i: {|x702,x701,NA(1),Payload(5)|}\_x308

   - Protocol mapping: B -> A : {|A,B,NA,Payload|}\_KAB — B now sends the payload encrypted under the session key `x308` (which the intruder chose).
   - Result: because the intruder chose `x308` earlier, it can decrypt this final message and recover `Payload(5)`.

**Result:** The attacker tricks A into encrypting the initial proposal to the attacker, substitutes a session key, uses the server's signed attestation to convince B of authenticity, and thereby obtains the final `Payload`. Confidentiality and authentication goals are violated.

**Important detail:** Each step from honest parties corresponds to a legal protocol action given what those parties _believe_ (i.e., the messages they received). The intruder's actions are constructible from information it can observe or produce. Therefore the attack is _executable_ under the protocol rules, and OFMC correctly finds a feasible interleaving that breaks the goals.

## Fix for Task 2

### What was wrong

- In the original protocol, A generated the session key `KAB` and sent `{A,B,NA,KAB}pk(B)`.
- The attacker could **redirect** this message so that A actually encrypted it under the attacker’s public key instead of B’s.
- This let the attacker substitute its own session key for B, then read the final `Payload`.
- Root cause: the **initial key offer wasn’t strongly bound to B**, so the attacker could control the key.

### What we changed

- We made A send **two separate messages**:
  1. The encrypted key proposal for B:  
     `{A,B,NA,KAB}pk(B)`  
     (so only B can decrypt it).
  2. A’s signature on the same data:  
     `{A,B,NA,KAB}inv(pk(A))`  
     (so B can verify it really came from A).

### Why this prevents the attack

- B now checks both the encrypted block **and** the signed block.
- The signature proves the key was generated by A and explicitly intended for B.
- The attacker cannot forge A’s signature, so it cannot trick B into accepting a fake key.

✅ **Result:** The attacker cannot substitute or control the session key anymore, and the final `Payload` stays secret between A and B.
